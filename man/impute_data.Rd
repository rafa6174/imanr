\title{Impute the data implementing random forest for native corn data.}
\usage{
impute_data(data, useParallel = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{An incomplete dataset that contains qualitative and quantitative
characteristics of a corn or series of corns. The selected characteristics
are related to colors, some measurements and the locations in which the corn
 was grown. A template for what has to be filled will be included in the
 GitHub page of the project.}

\item{useParallel}{Logical. Perform the analysis in parallel? Defaults to FALSE.}
}
\value{
\code{impute_data()}returns an imputed dataset that can be used with
 \code{find_racialcomplex()}.
}
\description{
"Impute and prepare a dataframe to apply the \code{find_racialcomplex()} function,
in case the dataframe has missing values. The imputation is done with random
 forests. The database must have the same variables as those in \code{bdMaiz.rds}
in this same package."
