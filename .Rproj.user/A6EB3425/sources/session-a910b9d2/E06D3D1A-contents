This package has been developed based on data collected by Proyecto Global de Maíces Nativos México, which has conducted exhaustive surveys across the country to document the qualitative and quantitative characteristics of different types of native maize. The trained model uses a robust and diverse dataset, enabling it to achieve an 80% accuracy in classifying maize racial complexes. The characteristics included in the analysis comprise geographic location, grain and cob colors, as well as various morphometric measurements, such as lengths and widths.",width=80))
