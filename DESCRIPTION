Description: A model that provides researchers with a powerful tool for the classification
    and study of native corn by aiding in the identification of racial complexes
    which are fundamental to Mexico's agriculture and culture. This package has been
    developed based on data collected by 'Proyecto Global de Maíces Nativos México',
    which has conducted exhaustive surveys across the country to document the
    qualitative and quantitative characteristics of different types of native maize.
    The trained model uses a robust and diverse dataset, enabling it to achieve an
    80% accuracy in classifying maize racial complexes. The characteristics included
    in the analysis comprise geographic location, grain and cob colors, as well as
    various morphometric measurements, such as lengths and widths.
